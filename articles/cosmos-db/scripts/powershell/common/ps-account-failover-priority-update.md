# Change failover priority or trigger failover for an Azure Cosmos account using PowerShell

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../../../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

[!INCLUDE [sample-powershell-install](../../../../../includes/sample-powershell-install-no-ssh.md)]

## Sample script

> [!NOTE]
> Any change to a region with `failoverPriority=0` triggers a manual failover and can only be done to an account configured for manual failover. Changes to all other regions simply changes the failover priority for a Cosmos account.
> [!NOTE]
> This sample demonstrates using a SQL (Core) API account. To use this sample for other APIs, copy the related properties and apply to your API specific script

[!code-powershell[main](../../../../../powershell_scripts/cosmosdb/common/ps-account-failover-priority-update.ps1 "Update failover priority for an Azure Cosmos account or trigger a manual failover")]
